## How to contribute to DIV?

Basically, make an issue, start a conversation, add code, change code, make pull and merge requests, do whatever you feel is necessary. Once DIV reaches alpha, it theoretically can become a replacement for Github itself, at that point making useful contributions could potentially earn you cryptographic tokens :) So it's in your interest to help us get there. 

In order to get things moving as regards to rewarding contributors, at the point DIV lifts off out of Github and becomes its' own development management platform, all contributions, attributions, and all the rest, will be linked to DIV user accounts, and relevant rewards will be calculated and assigned according to the rules of the system. So, even though you are not earning anythting now, if you make it so you can, you will.
